Question #2
    a) The Stundent class should be an abstract class because there are things that are shared
    amung all students of each classification. for example a student ID number, or a method 
    for calculating the GPA for a student. Also if you want to store all the students in a list,
    then an abstract class must be implemented so one could take advanatge of polymorphism.

    b) this method is flawed because we are not letting the object do something for us.
    This way of implimentation could lead to errors when maybe expanding to non, 3rd year 
    students. also, what if the 3rd year student needs to take another year for school.
    it would be better to have an attribute of 3rd year students tell us if they are about to graduate.
