Question #1 
    a) the UserFitness has low cohesion because it handles a lot of seemingly unrelated attributes.
    for example, it combines user profile data with nutrition tracking & workout tracking. the methods
    in the class are also very varried and do not aim twards a singular purpose. The class design is 
    overall inflexibale, not resuable, and serves a very narrow purpouse.

    b) to make a more cohesive deign I would create a UserProfile class, a WorkoutTracker class,
    a Nutrition tracker class, and a FintessReport Class. This allows for all the classes to
    individually complete a specific task. this also allows for aspects to be evolved independently
    from eachother. for example if the WorkoutTracker class needed to be updated, the other classes
    would remain unbothered.
